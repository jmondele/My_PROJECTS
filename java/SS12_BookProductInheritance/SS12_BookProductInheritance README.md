# 📚 SS12 - Book Class (Inherits Product Class)

## 📋 Description
This Java application demonstrates **class inheritance** by defining a `Book` class that **extends** the `Product` class. The `Book` class adds a new `author` field, includes constructors, and overrides the `print()` method to display all inherited and unique attributes.

---

## 💡 Features
- Inherits from the `Product` class (fields: `code`, `description`, `price`)
- Adds new field: `author`
- Includes:
  - No-arg and parameterized constructors
  - Getter and setter for `author`
  - Overridden `print()` method to include book-specific data
- Demonstrates:
  - Constructor chaining via `super()`
  - Object creation and method overriding

---

## 📂 Source Code
- [Product.java](../SS11_ProductClass/Product.java)  
- [Book.java](./Book.java)  
- [BookDemo.java](./BookDemo.java)
